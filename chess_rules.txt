BASIC RULES OF CHESS
Introduction
the lower right by the black Knight.
Chess is a game of strategy believed to have been invented
more then 1500 years ago in India. It is a game for two play-
ers, one with the light pieces and one with the dark pieces.
The chessboard is eight squares long by eight squares wide.
When sitting across the board from another player, the
lighter color square goes on each player’s right hand side
((cid:147)light on right(cid:148)) and the white queen is placed on a white
square and the black queen on the black square ((cid:147)queen on
her own color(cid:148)). The starting position of the pieces is shown
in the following chessboard:

Rook Moves
The Rook is the next most powerful piece. The Rook can
move any number of squares in one direction (cid:150) vertically
or horizontally(cid:150) if its path is not blocked. For example, the
squares this black Rook can move to are highlighted in the
chessboard below. It can capture the white Pawn to its left
but its path is blocked if it wants to move downward(cid:150)by its
black King.

The player with the white pieces moves (cid:2)rst and the players
then take turns moving. One piece may be moved at each
turn except for castling (which is described below).

Bishop Moves
The Queen can move in a straight line any number of
squares in any one direction - horizontal, vertical, or diago-
nal as long as its path is not blocked by its own pieces. It can
capture a piece of the opposite color in its path. Below, the
black Queen can reach any of the highlighed squares shown
in this diagram. It can capture the white Rook but its path is
blocked in some directions(cid:150)below by the black King and to
The Bishop can move any number of squares diagonally
if its path is not blocked. Note that this Bishop starts on
a light square and can reach only other light squares. At
the beginning of the game, you have one (cid:148)dark-square(cid:148)
Bishop and one (cid:148)light-square(cid:148) Bishop. The Bishop’s moves
are shown by the highlighted squares in the following chess-
board. This black Bishop can capture the white pawn but its

Knight Moves
The Knight’s move is special. It hops directly from its old
square to its new square. The Knight can jump over other
pieces between its old and new squares. Think of the
Knight’s move as an (cid:148)L.(cid:148) It moves two squares horizontally
or vertically and then makes a right-angle turn for one more
square ((cid:147)2 then 1(cid:148)). The Knight always lands on a square
opposite in color from its old square.

Pawn Moves (cid:4)
The Pawn moves straight ahead (never backward), but it
captures diagonally. It moves one square at a time, but on
its (cid:2)rst move it has the option of moving forward one or two
squares. In the diagram, the highlighted squares indicate
possible destinations for the pawns. The White pawn is on
its original square, so it may move ahead either one or two
squares. The black Pawn has already moved, so it may move
ahead only one square at a time or capture diagonally. The
squares on which these black Pawn may capture are indi-
cated by arrows. If a pawn advances all the way to the op-
posite end of the board, it is immediately (cid:148)promoted(cid:148) to an-
other piece, usually a Queen. It may not remain a pawn or
become a King. Therefore, it is possible for each player to
have more than one Queen or more than two Rooks, Bish-
ops, or Knights on the board at the same time.

King Moves
The King is the most important piece. When it is trapped,
the whole team loses. The King can move one square in any
direction - for example, to any of the highlighted squares in
this diagram. (An exception is castling, which is explained
later.) The King may never move into check - that is, onto a
Castling
Each player may castle only once during a game and only
when certain conditions are met. Castling is a special move
that lets a player move two pieces at once - the King and one

Rook. In castling, the player moves his King two squares ei-
ther to its left or right toward one of his Rooks. At the same
time, the Rook involved goes to the square on the other side
of the King. In order to castle, neither the King nor the Rook
involved may have moved before. Also, the King may not
castle out of check, into check, or through check. Further,
there may not be pieces of either color between the King
and the Rook involved in castling. The chessboard shown
below shows the white King before castling queen-side and
the black King before castling king-side.

Castling is often a very important move because it allows
you to place your King in a safe location and also allows the
Rook to become more active. When the move is legal, each
player has the choice of castling Kingside or Queenside or
not at all, no matter what the other player chooses to do.
En Passant
This French phrase is used for a special pawn capture. It
means (cid:148)in passing,(cid:148) and it occurs when one player moves a
pawn two squares forward to try to avoid capture by the op-
ponent’s pawn. The capture is made exactly as if the player
had moved the pawn only one square forward. In the chess-
board below, the White pawn moves up two squares from
its starting position. On its turn the Black pawn may cap-
ture the White pawn as shown by the arrow. If the Black
player does not exercise this option immediately (cid:150) before
playing some other move (cid:150) the White pawn is safe from (cid:147)en
passant(cid:148) capture for the rest of the game. But new oppor-
tunities may arise for each pawn in similar circumstances.

Check, Checkmate and Stalemate
The main goal of chess is to checkmate your opponent’s
King. The King is not actually captured and removed from
the board like other pieces. But if the King is attacked, we
say it is put in check and threatened with capture. It must
get out of check immediately. In the chess position shown
below, the black King is in check but there is one move that

is a stalemate.

If there is no way to get out of check, the position is a
checkmate and the side that is checkmated loses. In the
position shown below, there is no way for the black King to
escape the attacking white Queen by moving to the high-
lighted squares. And since the Queen is protected from at-
tack by the white Rook, white wins.

It is illegal for a king to move into check. If your King is
in check, there are three ways of getting out of check:
1. Capturing the attacking piece;
2. Placing one of your own pieces between the attacker
and your King (impossible if the attacker is a Knight);
3. Moving the King away from the attack.
If a checked player can do none of these, he is checkmated
and loses the game.
If a King is not in check, and that player can make no le-
gal move, the position is called a stalemate and the game
is scored as a draw, or tie, with each player recieving a half
point. In the chessboard show below, it is white’s turn to
move and since there are no moves for the white pawn and
every move puts the white King into check, we say the game

Fool’s Mate and Scholar’s Mate
Fool’s Mate occurs when a player opens up his King to a fa-
tal attack as shown in the following game:

It is rarely a good idea to move the pawns on f2, g2 and h2 so
early in the game as the King normally castles on this side
and if the pawns have been moved, they can no longer offer
him adequate protection.
The following game illustrates Scholar’s Mate. This is a
checkmate whereby the Bishop and Queen attack the weak
f7 pawn. This pawn is weak because, in the starting posi-
tion, it is only protected by the King.

Pins, Forks, and Skewers
Basic Opening Strategy
1. Control the center squares. Open with one of the two
center pawns, the pawns in front of your king and
queen. The idea is simple: every early move should
try to take better control over the center of the board.
2. All of your early moves should aim to develop a piece,
preferably in a way that threatens something; perhaps
an opponent’s piece or to take (cid:2)rm control over the
center.
3. A general rule of thumb is to bring out your Knights
before your Bishops. Most of the time, it is fairly clear
where the knights ought to be developed. The best
squares for the bishops become apparent only a bit
later.
4. Try not to move a piece more than once in the opening
unless you can capture something or gain something
important. In other words, don’t start attacking until
all or at least most of your pieces are developed.
5. Do not bring your queen out early. If you do, you may
lose it or at best lose time moving it around when your
opponent attacks it. Wait with your queen until you
are sure you know where it’s going.
6. And do not sacri(cid:2)ce material until you know you are
getting something valuable for it
A pin occurs when a piece is attacked and if it moves, a piece
of greater value will be under attack. So the piece is said to
be pinned to its position.
A fork occurs when a piece (not always a knight!) attacks
two or more pieces at the same time as shown in the follow-
ing diagram:

A skewer is similar to a pin except in this case the piece
of greater value (for example, the King, Queen or Rook) is
in front. An enemy piece attacks the piece and when this
piece moves away, it leaves a piece of lesser value exposed
to capture. Below the Bishop is Skewering the Black King
and Queen. The King must move out of check and the White
Bishop captures the Black Queen!
